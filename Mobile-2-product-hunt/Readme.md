# Product Hunt API Model

Creating swift models in order to fetch data structures that are in JSON (Javascript Object Notation). Display data in our app using a UITableView. Goal was to fetch product hunt posts and comments related to that post.

## Getting Started

In order to create models for the project hunt api we had to simulate a GET request, by using an application called postman. Postman acted as a HTTP Client and based on the url parameters would return information requested. Once postman received the requested data it displays the raw JSON, and as a result we are able to see how the data is formatted. We are then able to create models in swift so that we can manipulate the data in our app once it is received.

## Built With
